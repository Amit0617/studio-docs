# Add the Smart Contracts interface

After you've created the definitions file, add the contracts ABIs to the folder called **Contracts**

## ABIs

The first thing we'll add to the Contracts folder is the ABIs for all contracts that you want to add to Zapper.

This is as simple as looking the contract up in EtherScan.io, navigating to the code section of the contract and xxxx <!-- TODO add details-->

<!-- TODO make this more clear and helpful-->
:::danger If the smart contracts you are adding are not verified on EtherScan, you might have to do some digging to get the ABIs 
:::

Create a new file per contract being added in the Contracts folder. These file names need to match the groupids you defined in the Definitions.ts file. <!--TODO is this true?-->

## Ethers
<!--TODO define how Ethers is generated-->
Next, you'll creat a folder called Ethers by xxxx

## Index.js file
After you run the script, this is created <!-- TODO clarify what this-->
