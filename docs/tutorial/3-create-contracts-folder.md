# Add the Smart Contracts interface

After you've created your app, add the contracts ABI in **/contracts/abis**

## ABIs

The first thing we'll add to the Contracts folder is the ABIs for all contracts that you want to add to Zapper.

This is as simple as looking the contract up in EtherScan.io, navigating to the code section of the contract and xxxx <!-- TODO add details-->

<!-- TODO make this more clear and helpful-->
:::danger If the smart contracts you are adding are not verified on EtherScan, you might have to do some digging to get the ABIs 
:::

Create a new file per contract being added in the Contracts folder. These file names need to match the groupids you defined in the Definitions.ts file. <!--TODO is this true?-->

## Ethers
<!--TODO define how Ethers is generated-->
Next, you'll create a folder called Ethers. This can be generated by the cli command called `codegen:contracts-factory`. It will produce a Typescript definition file for each ABIs, that will then be available to import in the app fetchers to interact with the contract.

## Index.js file
After you run the previous command, this is also created <!-- TODO clarify what this-->
