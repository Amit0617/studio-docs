# Submit your app integration PR

All you now need to do is submit your application for review by the team. If you followed these steps, you should be in good shape.

A big thing to be aware of is to follow the guidelines laid out in contributing.md, to ensure you are following Zapper's coding standards. Please look at that file and incorporate its guidelines into your code to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth between you and the Zapper team reviewing your PR.

<!--TODO link to contributing.mnd-->

Once you're sure you've followed those guidelines, hit submit! The Zapper team will review your PR in the next 24-48 hours-- please do not ping the team asking for review until 48 hours have passed.
